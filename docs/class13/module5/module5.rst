NGINX App Protect WAF Dashboard
===============================


Let's start off to review the dashboard for NGINX App Protect WAF. 

The overall solution uses Logstash to receive logs from NGINX App Protect, process them and finally store them in Elasticsearch indexes. Grafana retrieves the logs 
from the Elastic indexes and helps us visualize them.

The SupportID Dashboard provides all details for a specific transaction that was logged by NGINX App Protect WAF. These include the following:

* Client/Server Information (Client IP/Port, Server IP/Port, X-Forwared-For, etc)
* Violation Details (Outcome, Request Status, Outcome Reson, etc)
* Bot Details (Bot Classm Bot Category, Bit Signature, etc)
* Device Details (NAP Device name, Vritual Server Name)
* Signatures Triggered

The following dashboard are currently under development and should be released shortly:

* File Type Violations
* Header/Cookie Violations
* Parameter Violations
* Evasion Techniques
* HTTP Protocol Compliance
* URL Violations

Generating attacks
------------------

In the following section we will generate multiple attacks so that the dashboards get populated with meaningful data that we can review.

To run the demos, use the terminal on VS Code. VS Code is under the `bigip-01` on the `Access` drop-down menu. Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F5EMEA/oltra/main/vscode.png"> here </a> to see how.*

Change the working directory to `monitoring`.

.. code:: bash
   
   cd ~/oltra/use-cases/app-protect/monitoring


### Step 1. Deploy and protect a web application  

Create the application deployment and service in namespace `nap`:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl create namespace nap
   kubectl apply -f app.yml

Create the App Protect policy.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl apply -f appolicy.yml


Create log configuration resource:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl apply -f log.yml


Create the policy to reference the AP Policy, the AP Log profile and the log destination.

.. code:: bash
   kubectl apply -f policy.yml


Create the VirtualServer resource:

.. code:: bash
   kubectl apply -f virtual-server.yml


Send a request to the application.


.. code:: bash
   curl http://nap-monitor.f5k8s.net/

.. code:: bash

   #####################  Expected output  #######################
   Server address: 10.244.140.109:8080
   Server name: nap-monitor-7586895968-r26zn
   Date: 12/Sep/2022:14:12:25 +0000
   URI: /
   Request ID: 0495d6a17797ea9776120d5f4af10c1a


Step 2. Execute malicious requests to the application  

Now, let's try to send a malicious request to the application:

SQL Injection (encoded)

.. code:: bash
      
   curl "http://nap-monitor.f5k8s.net/index.php?password=0%22%20or%201%3D1%20%22%0A"

SQL Injection

.. code:: bash

   curl "http://nap-monitor.f5k8s.net/index.php?password==0'%20or%201=1'"

SQL Injection

.. code:: bash

   curl "http://nap-monitor.f5k8s.net/index.php?id=%'%20or%200=0%20union%20select%20null,%20version()%23"

Cross Site Scripting

.. code:: bash

   curl "http://nap-monitor.f5k8s.net/index.php?username=<script>"

Command Injection

.. code:: bash
      
   curl "http://nap-monitor.f5k8s.net/index.php?id=0;%20ls%20-l"


The expected output  for all the previous requests is the following:

.. code:: bash

   <html><head><title>Request Rejected</title></head><body>The requested URL was rejected........ ```

Step 3. Review Logs 
-------------------


Login to Grafana (credentials **admin/Ingresslab123**)

.. image:: images/login.png

Go to **Dashboards->Browse**

.. image:: images/browse.png


Select the NAP Dashboards that can be located under the NGINX folder

.. image:: images/dashboards.png

Navigate through the different Dashboards to review the attacks.


***Clean up the environment (Optional)***

.. code:: bash

   kubectl delete -f .

(Add summary page aftewards with thoughts?)
