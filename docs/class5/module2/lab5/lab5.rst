Test the WAF Policy by Replicating the SQL Injection Attack
===========================================================

1. Now that the WAF policy is applied, retry the SQL injection attack to see if the attempt is blocked.  In UDF, open a new webshell connection to NGINX Instance Manager under Systems > ACCESS.  Copy the command below and paste it into the webshell (Command/Shift+Ctrl+V).

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST -k -H "host: diy.arcadia-finance.io" "https://nginx-plus-2.appworld.lab/trading/auth.php&\'+or+1=1;--"


2. As shown below, a support ID is generated when the response is returned. **Select and copy this value** so that you can search for it in SM.
