Lab 2 (OPTIONAL): Make new code commit, push changes using command line tools, and deploy
=========================================================================================

In this task, we will run through a similar process achieving similar results executing commands in a bash shell.

1.  Open **git bash for windows** using the **Git Bash** icon on the Windows desktop. Git Bash is a bash shell emulator, similar to what you see natively on Linux and Unix machines. If the git console font is too small to read, use **Ctrl+ “+”** to increase the font

2.  Make sure you are in appster project root:
    ``~/Documents/Git/gitlabappster`` . To get there, type the following
    command in the Git Bash shell:

    .. code-block:: bash

       cd ~/Documents/Git/gitlabappster
       ls

    .. image:: ../images/image20.png

3.  We can change the the subheader
    using \ `sed <https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html>`__.
    ``sed`` command in UNIX stands for *Stream EDitor*, and it can
    perform lots of function on file like searching, find and replace,
    insertion or deletion

    Let’s search and replace the the existing subheader
    ``A beautiful fictitious app that you can trust on`` with ``A beautiful fictitious app that you can trust!``.

    .. code:: bash

       # Update "A beautiful fictitious app that you can trust on" 
       # with "A beautiful fictitious app that you can trust!" in the HTML
       sed -i 's/can trust on/can trust!/g' etc/nginx/html/index.html

4.  Let’s check that our changes were made by performing a ``grep`` text
    search on the ``index.html`` file

    .. code:: bash

       # Do a grep search and look for the subheader
       cat etc/nginx/html/index.html | grep "A beautiful"

       <h2>A beautiful <span class="text-orange">fictitious</span> app that you can trust!</h2>

5.  We now can commit and push changes to the git code repository using
    **git commands** instead of the GitHub Desktop Client. Type the
    following three commands sequentially.

    .. code:: bash

       git add .
       git commit -m "Update subheader"
       git push origin master

    If prompted for credentials, enter our Gitlab username and password:
    ``udf`` / ``P@ssw0rd20``

    A successful push will look like the following:

    .. image:: ../images/image22.png

6.  We view the changes made in the new code deployment in a web
    browser. Check the gitlab pipeline to ensure that the staging environment has been deployed.
    Remember that you may need to reload the webpage if you
    currently have the webpage open, or open the webpage in a \ **New
    incognito window** (**Ctrl + Shift + N**) to bypass browser cache
    and view updated changes

    .. image:: ../images/image24.png

    .. image:: ../images/image25.png

7.  If you prefer a different subheader again, we can change it again
    using \ `sed <https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html>`__
    this time performing a search and replace of the the HTML code
    containing ``A beautiful fictitious app that you can trust!`` with
    ``Whatever you want!``.

    For example we are matching the entire html ``<h2>`` block and have
    `escaped <http://dwaves.de/tools/escape/>`__ the HTML code:

    .. code:: bash

       sed -i 's/<h2>A beautiful <span class=\"text-orange\">fictitious<\/span> app that you can trust!<\/h2>/<h2>A beautiful <span class=\"text-orange\">fictitious<\/span> app that you should download!<\/h2>/g' etc/nginx/html/index.html

8.  Let’s check that our changes were made by performing a
    ``grep`` text search on the ``index.html`` file

    .. code:: bash

       # Do a grep search and look for the subheader
       cat etc/nginx/html/index.html | grep "A beautiful"

       <h2>A beautiful <span class="text-orange">fictitious</span> app that you should download!</h2>

9.  Commit and push the changes to the code repository:

    .. code:: bash

       git add .
       git commit -m "Update subheader"
       git push origin master

    Again, if prompted for credentials, use: ``udf`` / ``P@ssw0rd20``

    A successful push will look like the following:

    .. image:: ../images/image22.png

10. Browse back to the **Appster** repo on **Gitlab**, click the
    pipeline status icon to get back to the detailed pipeline progress
    page and watch the build process in real-time


    .. image:: ../images/image28.png

    .. image:: ../images/image29.png   

11. Once the staging deployment is complete, we can view the changes made in the new code deployment
    using a web browser. Remember that you may need to reload the webpage
    if you currently have the webpage open, or open the webpage in
    a \ **New incognito window** (**Ctrl + Shift + N**) to bypass
    browser cache and view updated changes
